## Displaying the models

To display the models present in the model library you need to setup a folder in the software preferences, choose the Wolvenkit-CLI executable, at least version 8.14.x and from the build menu Build the repository, then the microblends normals and decals for the software

## If you want to compile it, clone the repository, then
```
cd MlsetupBuilder

npm install .

npx electron .
```

You are good to go. Happy Modding!
